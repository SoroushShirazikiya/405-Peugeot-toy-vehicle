# 405-Peugeot-toy-vehicle
This is my CATIA V5 model of a Peugeot 405 vehicle. It’s part of my personal portfolio to demonstrate advanced surface modeling and automotive design skills.  I’m sharing my work to support my goal of earning a fully funded PhD position in mechanical engineering. Each design reflects both my passion and technical growth in CAD.
